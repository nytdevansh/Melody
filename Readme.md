## Architecture

### Project Structure
```
app/src/main/java/com/example/melody/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MainActivity.kt                 # Main activity and UI logic
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ adapter/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ SongAdapter.kt             # RecyclerView adapter for song list
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ data/
‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Song.kt                    # Song data class
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MusicRepository.kt         # Music scanning and management
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ service/
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ MusicPlayerService.kt      # Background music playback service
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ MusicServer.kt             # HTTP server for music streaming
```

### Key Components

#### MainActivity
- Handles UI interactions and lifecycle
- Manages permissions and initialization
- Coordinates between repository and service

#### MusicRepository
- Scans device for music files using MediaStore
- Provides song data to the UI
- Implements search and filtering functionality

#### MusicPlayerService
- Background service for music playback
- Manages MediaPlayer instance
- Provides foreground notification during playback

#### MusicServer
- Built-in HTTP server on port 8080
- Enables potential remote access to music library
- Handles client connections and requests

## Configuration

### Server Configuration
The built-in HTTP server runs on port 8080 by default. You can modify this in `MainActivity.kt`:

```kotlin
companion object {
    private const val SERVER_PORT = 8080  // Change this port if needed
}
```

### Notification Configuration
Customize the music playback notification in `MusicPlayerService.kt`:

```kotlin
private fun createNotification(): Notification {
    return NotificationCompat.Builder(this, CHANNEL_ID)
        .setContentTitle("Your App Name")  // Customize title
        .setContentText(currentSong?.title ?: "Playing music")
        .setSmallIcon(R.drawable.ic_music_note)  // Use your icon
        .build()
}
```

## Usage

### First Launch
1. **Grant Permissions**: Allow storage access when prompted
2. **Initial Scan**: The app will automatically scan your device for music files
3. **Browse Library**: View your music collection in the main list

### Playing Music
1. **Select Song**: Tap any song from the list to start playback
2. **Background Play**: Music continues playing when you minimize the app
3. **Notification Controls**: Use the notification to see what's playing

### Refreshing Library
- Tap the "Refresh Music Library" button to rescan for new music files
- Useful after adding new music to your device

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Music Found
- **Check Permissions**: Ensure storage permissions are granted
- **Verify Music Files**: Confirm you have music files on your device
- **File Formats**: Ensure music files are in supported formats (MP3, MP4, etc.)
- **File Size**: Very small files (< 100KB) are filtered out

#### App Crashes on Startup
- **Update Android**: Ensure your device runs a supported Android version
- **Clear Cache**: Clear app cache and data from device settings
- **Reinstall**: Uninstall and reinstall the app

#### Music Won't Play
- **File Access**: Check if the music file still exists at its location
- **Audio Focus**: Close other audio apps that might be using audio resources
- **Storage Space**: Ensure device has sufficient free storage

#### Server Issues
- **Port Conflict**: Change the server port if 8080 is already in use
- **Network Access**: Check if your device allows the app to use network

### Debug Information
Enable debug logging by checking Android Studio's Logcat for messages tagged with:
- `MainActivity`
- `MusicRepository`
- `MusicPlayerService`
- `MusicServer`
